# Youth Homelessness Project
## Youth Homelessness Project for Valencia BAS CTSD Senior Capstone - Spring 2023
### Continuation of Capstone Summer and Fall 2022 Project

This is a Java Spring MVC project which collects data via survey and presents helpful resources based on responses. The anonymous data collected can then be used by city officials to generate reports which will help them visualize the problem and develop targeted solutions.

Survey questions were inspired by this [Student Financial Wellness Survey](https://valenciacollege.edu/academics/analytics-and-planning/institutional-evaluation/research-and-evaluation/documents/valencia_fall2020-sfws-school-report.pdf).
